# Descriptions of columns in data file

Each row is data from one participant. 

Participants were shown ten vignettes (V1-V10) and two types of explanation for each one, and two possible explanations, and invisible-hand one (IH), and an intentional-design one (ID). Participants were asked to chose the explanation they thought best explanation the outcome of the vignette. Participants were also given the General Conspiratorial Belief scale (GCB).

The order of presentation of vignettes and explanation types was randomized. 

* `Qi`: The participant response to vignette i and the associated IH and ID explanations. A value of 1 indicates choosing the IH, a value of -1 indicates choosing the ID. 
* `Qi_time`: The time it took the participant to make their choice for vignette i. 
* `Total_Time`: The time (in seconds) it took the participant to answer the questions. 
* `GCB_i`: Participant agreement with statement i in the General Conspiratorial Belief scale, from 1 to 5.
