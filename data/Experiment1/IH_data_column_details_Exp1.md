# Descriptions of columns in data file

Each row is data from one participant. 

Participants were shown ten vignettes (V1-V10) and two types of explanation for each one, an invisible-hand one (IH) and an intentional-design one (ID).

The order of presentation of vignettes and explanation types was randomized. 

* `Qj_Vi_ID`: The likelihood assigned by the participant to the outcome in Vignette i coming about as a result of the IH cause. 
* `Qj_Vi_IH`: The likelihood assigned by the participant to the outcome in Vignette i coming about as a result of the ID cause. 
* `GCB_i`: Participant agreement with statement i in the General Conspiratorial Belief scale, from 1 to 5.
* `Total_Time`: The time (in seconds) it took the participant to answer the questions.
