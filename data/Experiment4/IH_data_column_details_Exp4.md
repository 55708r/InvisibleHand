# Descriptions of columns in data file

Each row is data from one participant. 

The data contains 2 conditions, one for each vignette (Vignettes 3, 4, and 8). 

All column names with `v3` belong to Vignette 3.
All column names with `v4` belong to Vignette 4.
All column names with `v8` belong to Vignette 8.

* `i_vj_preference`: Participant response to the explanation pair i, for vignette j. The value 1 means the invisible-hand explanation was preferred. The value 2 means the intentional-design explanation was preferred.
* `explain`: Participant response to the statement `Please describe, in a few words, what were you asked to do in this experiment?`

For each participant, the order of the presentation of the explanation pairs was randomized. 

For each explanation pair, the order of presentation of the explanation type was randomized (some people saw the invisible-hand explanation first, some people saw it second).
